In short:
 Marine research careers are for those who want to explore, protect, and better understand the ocean—our planet’s largest, most mysterious, and most vital ecosystem.


Ag Research
Jobs in food systems or agriculture research focus on understanding and improving how we produce, distribute, consume, and sustain food—from soil to plate. These roles span disciplines like agronomy, ecology, climate science, public health, economics, and policy, and aim to make food systems more resilient, equitable, and sustainable.

In short:
 Pollution and remediation research jobs are ideal for those who want to clean up past environmental damage, prevent future harm, and protect people and the planet through rigorous science and applied innovation.


Waste Research
Jobs in waste research focus on understanding, managing, reducing, and repurposing waste—from municipal trash and food scraps to industrial, hazardous, and electronic waste. These roles help design more sustainable, circular systems that protect public health, reduce pollution, and conserve resources.
